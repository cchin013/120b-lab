Mini Galaga is a stripped down version of the arcade game Galaga by Namco Japan.
The player controls a ship that can move horizontally or vertically in a 2x3 rectangle on the screen and can shoot bullets horizontally across the screen.
The player must accumulate points by damaging the enemy while simultaneously dodging the enemyâ€™s bullets.
If the player is hit by any enemy attacks, they will lose a life until they have no lives left at which point the game is over.
